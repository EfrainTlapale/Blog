I'm a web developer, mainly focus on JavaScript, but i try to work on other languages like Go or Ruby

I'm kind of a full stack developer, I don't consider myself as an expert in frontend or backend, but more like a Junior dev in both  

I really like JavaScript, its ecosystem, its libraries and frameworks, my favorites are React (dah) and Vue in the frontend and Express and SocketIO in the backend

In this blog I'm trying to transfer some knowledge and reinforce mine own writing, English, programming skills and understanding
